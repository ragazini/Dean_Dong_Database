# Dean_Dong_Database

|| This is a quick guide to help you navigate through the program ||

1. For quick access to our database, once registered, you can view it by typing "python vip_login.py <username> <password>" on the command line.

2. Our randomly generated password option is made up of 3 different choices: weak, regular and strong. They all have the same length (8 characters) but will use different types of characters in order to protect it more. 3D team recommends choosing the strongest option.

3. If you find errors or would like to suggest changes in the code, please e-mail us: support@3D.com.au.
