# Dean_Dong_Database

|| This is a quick guide to help you navigate through the program ||

1. The easiest way to use this repo is to fork it then run the main file (login.py) on VSCode. Make sure all files are inside a folder (just like in the repo). You will notice a few copies of the original files. They are  there for safety reasons, you won't need them to run the program.

2. Our randomly generated password option is made up of 3 different choices: weak, regular and strong. They all have the same length (8 characters) but will use different types of characters in order to protect it more. 3D team recommends choosing the strongest option.

3. For quick access to our database, once registered, you can view it by typing "python vip_login.py <username> <password>" on the command line.

4. If you find errors or would like to suggest changes in the code, please e-mail us: support@3D.com.au.
